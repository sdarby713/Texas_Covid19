# Texas_Covid19

Every day during the duration of the Covid19 pandemic, the local Houston Chronicle publishes a map of Texas with each county colored to show the prevalence of total Covid cases in the county's population.  But I thought it would be just as interesting to see a visualization of new cases for each day, where and how many.  So I have created a program that will process the data file provided by the Texas Department of Health and Human Services into a form suitable for display in a Tableau map.
